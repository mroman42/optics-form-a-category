* Optics form a category, graphically
This is a short note that slightly extends the graphical calculus Mitchell Riley ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738][Categories of Optics]], 2018) introduced for monoidal optics to the general case of arbitrary optics.  This graphical calculus is then used to prove that optics for a strong monoidal action form a category.  Compare these simple proofs with unintuitive formal derivations of this same author (Rom√°n, Profunctor optics and traversals).

This proof is obsolete after [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04526]["Open Diagrams Via Coend Calculus"]]. If you want to reference this note, please do so by referencing that ArXiV note instead.
